 ## Python Dictionary
 The json file has two attribute: <br />
    &nbsp; 1) "T" is length of total test case number <br />
    &nbsp; 2) "testCases" have four attribute <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 2-1) "N" is number of "dictionary" content <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 2-2) "Q" is number of "queries" content <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 2-3) "dictionary" shows connections between words (if two word is in "dictionary" then this means this words are <br />
        &nbsp; synonyms and if one conent is ["A", "B"] second's content ["B", "C"] then "A" and "C" are synonyms, if there is <br />
        &nbsp; any connection between two word means they are different.) <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; 2-4) "queries" is test content. <br />

 To execute code run "python source.py" command in terminal after editing "input_file_path" and "output_file_path" in "source.py". <br />
